description: Learn how to set up PostgreSQL with Docker in this tutorial. PostgreSQL is a stable and feature-rich open-source relational database management system, while Docker is a platform for building and running distributed applications. The tutorial covers the process of pulling the PostgreSQL Docker image, starting a PostgreSQL container, and connecting to the PostgreSQL server within the container. Additionally, it explores configuring various aspects of the PostgreSQL server, such as setting the default encoding, locale, and time zone. You'll also discover how to make your data persistent using volumes. The tutorial concludes by highlighting the convenience of using PostgreSQL with Docker and how it simplifies server management and configuration. Get started with PostgreSQL and Docker for an efficient and streamlined database setup.

#### üêò What's Postgres?

**PostgreSQL** is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is known for its stability, performance, and feature-richness. **Docker** is a platform that enables users to build, ship, and run distributed applications. In this blog post, we will look at how to use and configure **PostgreSQL** with **Docker**.


#### üê≥ Pull PostgreSQL Docker image

To use **PostgreSQL** with **Docker**, you first need to install **Docker** on your machine. You can follow the instructions on the **Docker** website to install **Docker** on your system. Once you have **Docker** installed, you can run the following command to pull the latest version of the **PostgreSQL** **Docker** image:

```bash
docker pull postgres:15-alpine
```

This will download the latest **PostgreSQL** 15 alpine **Docker** image to your machine. Once the image is downloaded, you can run the following command to start a **PostgreSQL** container:

#### üöÄ Start PostgreSQL container

```bash
docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres:15-alpine
```

This command will start a **PostgreSQL** container with the name "my-postgres" and set the password for the default "postgres" user to "mysecretpassword". You can replace these values with your own desired values.

#### üñ• Connect to PostgreSQL server

Once the container is running, you can connect to the **PostgreSQL** server inside the container by running the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it my-postgres psql -U postgres
```

This will connect to the **PostgreSQL** server inside the "my-postgres" container and log you in as the "postgres" user. From here, you can execute SQL commands to create databases, tables, and manage your data.


#### üõ† Configure PostgreSQL server

In addition to the basic usage described above, you can also configure various aspects of the **PostgreSQL** server running inside the **Docker** container. For example, you can set the default encoding, locale, and time zone for the server by using the following command:

```bash
docker run --name my-postgres \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
-e POSTGRES_DB=mydb \
-v ${HOME}/.postgres-data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data:Z \
-e POSTGRES_ENCODING=UTF8 \
-e POSTGRES_LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 \
-e POSTGRES_LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 \
-e POSTGRES_TZ=America/New_York \
-p 5432:5432 \
-d postgres:15-alpine
```

In this command, we have set the default encoding to UTF-8, the default locale to "en_US.UTF-8", the default time zone to "America/New_York", and the default database to "mydb" also creates a volume to make your data persistent if you delete or recreate your container. You can replace these values with your own desired values.


‚èØ Start or stop PostgreSQL instance

After doing that you can start or stop your DB instance with

```bash
docker my-postgres start
docker my-postgres stop
```
üí° In conclusion

Use **PostgreSQL** with **Docker** is a great way to quickly and easily get a **PostgreSQL** server up and running on your machine. **Docker** makes it easy to manage the **PostgreSQL** server, and allows you to configure various aspects of the server to suit your needs. If you are new to **PostgreSQL** and **Docker**, I hope this blog post has given you a good starting point for using these tools together.
